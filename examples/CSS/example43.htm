      <h2>Global Warming</h2>
      <div class='leftsidebar'>
      According to the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental
      Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global surface temperature increased
      1.33 +/- 0.32 &deg;F during the 20th century.</div>

      Global warming is the increase in the average temperature of Earth's
      near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected
      continuation. Most of the observed temperature increase since the middle
      of the 20th century was caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse
      gases, which results from human activity such as the burning of fossil
      fuel and deforestation. aerosols that block sunlight from reaching the
      surface, has partially countered the effects of greenhouse gas induced
      warming. Climate model projections summarized in the latest IPCC report
      indicate that the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further
      2.0 to 11.5 &deg;F during the 21st century. The uncertainty in this
      estimate arises from the use of models with differing sensitivity to
      greenhouse gas concentrations and the use of differing estimates of
      future greenhouse gas emissions.

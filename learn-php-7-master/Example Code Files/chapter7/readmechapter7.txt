The dog_data program is set to have the change log and error files in the same folder as the application.
You will need to change the location of the error log (in dog_container) to a valid location on your system.
If you do not change this information you will receive errors.

The current version of PHP on this support server is older and does not support password_verify.

Download the files and run on a newer PHP server.
